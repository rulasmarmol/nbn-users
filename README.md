# nbn-users

### What you'll need

* [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Kubernetes enabled
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* If you already installed minikube, then you need to switch the context to docker-desktop (instead of minikube), otherwise the load balancer will not work. You can change the context in the context menu of docker or you can try this:
```
kubectl config use-context docker-for-desktop
```
	

## 1. Database setup

### Deployment config
```
kubectl apply -f mongo-deployment.yaml
```

### Service startup
```
kubectl apply -f mongo-service.yaml
```

### Verify installation
```
kubectl get all 
```
You should see something like this:
```
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/database           ClusterIP      None            <none>        <none>         4h5m

NAME                                  READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/mongodb-standalone   1/1     4h6m
```

## 2. Application setup

### Compile and download dependencies
```
mvn package
```

### Build and image creation
```
docker build -t nbn-user:latest .
```

### Deployment config
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Service startup
```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

### Verify installation
```
kubectl get all 
```
You should see something like this:
```

```
It make take some time to get all the pods running, so maybe you will see a Creating STATUS instead of Running, or something like that. 

At this point everything is running and you can test the application on your browser, but you don't have any id to test, so you need to retrieve some ids from the database, otherwise you're going to get an empty object. If you just want to if the application is running then go to step four and type anything on the id.

## 3. Fetch some ids from the database

### Connect to the container using sh
```
kubectl exec -it mongodb-standalone-0 sh
```

### Connect to the database 
```
mongo mongodb://database:27017
```

### Select dbs
```
use test
```

### Fetch some ids
```
db.user.find()
```
Then you will see something like this:
```
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5e86782bb56123011271f5a4"), "name" : "Carlos", "age" : 32, "_class" : "nbn.entities.User" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5e86782bb56123011271f5a5"), "name" : "Citlalli", "age" : 29, "_class" : "nbn.entities.User" }
```

## 4. Test 
Type this in the address bar of your browser:
```
http://localhost:80/user?id=5e86782bb56123011271f5a4
```
You will see one of the previous registers in the database:
```
{"id":"5e86782bb56123011271f5a4","name":"Carlos","age":32}
```
